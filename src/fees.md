Glow Finance offers a transparent fee structure, ensuring competitive rates across its ecosystem.

## Main App Fees

### 1. Lending Pool Fee (Lending Interest Split)

When a borrower pays interest on their loan, that interest is normally paid to the depositors (i.e. users who lent their assets to the pool).

Glow takes **a 20% cut from that interest** as a **protocol fee**. So the interest paid by the borrower is split like this:

- **80%** goes to the **depositors** as yield.
- **20%** goes to **Glow** as a protocol fee.

**Example**:  
If a borrower pays **100 USDC** in interest over time:

- **80 USDC** goes to depositors.
- **20 USDC** is taken by Glow as a fee.

### 2. Liquidation Fee

If an account is liquidated (i.e. collateral is sold off to repay debt), Glow charges a **5% fee** on the value of the assets being liquidated.

**Summary**:

| Action      | Who Pays? | Fee Amount              | Where It Goes                        |
| ----------- | --------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Borrowing   | Borrower  | 20% of interest         | To Glow (taken from depositor yield) |
| Liquidation | Borrower  | 5% of amount liquidated | To Glow                              |
