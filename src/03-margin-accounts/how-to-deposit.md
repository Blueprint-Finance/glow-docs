Glow makes it easy to earn interest on your assets. Instead of letting them sit idly in a wallet, you can deposit your assets with just a couple clicks to immediately begin lending to borrowers and earn the displayed APY for that asset!

Glow Finance offers multiple easy ways to deposit assets into their margin accounts, as long as you have already [created a margin account](../03-margin-accounts/how-to-create-a-margin-account.md).

Glow Finance ensures that depositing is seamless, whether you're navigating from the Markets page, the Portfolio Dashboard, or using the quick-access **Deposit** button.

Regardless of the method, all deposit actions ultimately lead to the **Asset Details Page**, where you can confirm the amount and complete the transaction.

Once your wallet is connected and your margin account is created, you can follow these steps to deposit your assets:

## 1. Using the Top-Right Deposit Button

- **Step 1:** In the [Margin Account Panel](../margin-accounts/portfolio-management#margin-account-panel-explainer), locate the **Deposit** button in the top-right corner.
