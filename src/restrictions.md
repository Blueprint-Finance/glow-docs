At Glow Finance, we prioritize compliance with international laws and regulations. As part of this commitment, access to our services is restricted in certain jurisdictions, including:

- **United States**: Restricted due to regulatory compliance requirements.
- **OFAC-Sanctioned Countries**: These are countries and regions sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), including:
  - **North Korea**
  - **Iran**
  - **Syria**
  - **Cuba**
  - **Russia**
  - **Crimea region of Ukraine**
  - **South Sudan**

These restrictions are in place to comply with sanctions that limit access to financial services and technologies. Glow Finance prohibits users from these jurisdictions from engaging with our platform to maintain adherence to global regulatory standards.
