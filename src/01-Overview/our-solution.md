Designed for sophisticated investors and large-scale users, Glow introduces a suite of financial tools aimed at maximizing capital efficiency and enhancing yield opportunities.

## Current DeFi Protocols Limitations

The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector has grown rapidly since its early days, but the promise of true composability and capital efficiency remains largely unfulfilled. Traditional DeFi models, dominated by protocols like Compound, have relied on over-collateralized lending mechanisms that, while effective, impose significant limitations. Once assets are locked into these lending pools, they become static, reducing flexibility and making it difficult for users to redeploy capital without exposing themselves to liquidation risks.

Glow Finance is built to address theses limitations head-on.

## Why Glow Protocol Is Different?

The Glow protocol isn’t just about offering traditional DeFi services in a new package; it’s about fundamentally rethinking how capital can be mobilized and utilized within the DeFi space. Whether it’s through the ability to leverage staked assets without having to withdraw and lose staking rewards or the capacity to swap borrowed assets directly for other yield-bearing assets, Glow empowers users to make their capital work harder.

By harnessing the speed, scalability, and security of the Solana blockchain and its Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) architecture, Glow provides a flexible and innovative environment for users looking to optimize their strategies. Our cross-margin account capabilities allow for dynamic interaction between assets, enabling users to manage, borrow, and leverage positions within a unified framework. With on-chain margin accounts, lending pools, and leverage swaps, Glow unlocks a new level of composability that has been missing from traditional DeFi models.

Glow’s approach is not just incremental but transformative. By offering tools that allow for seamless integration and utilization of borrowed funds, Glow paves the way for more sophisticated and efficient strategies. This adaptability is what sets Glow apart and positions it as a key player in the evolving DeFi ecosystem.
