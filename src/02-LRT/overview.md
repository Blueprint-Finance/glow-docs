Liquid restaking is a **DeFi mechanism** that allows users to stake their assets (e.g., SOL, ETH) in a blockchain protocol or validator network to earn staking rewards, while simultaneously unlocking the liquidity of those staked assets. Instead of being locked up, the value of the staked assets can be utilized elsewhere in DeFi, creating more opportunities for capital efficiency.

- **Uninterrupted Staking Rewards:** Users continue to earn rewards from the underlying blockchain’s staking process.
- **Liquidity Access:** Users can access and use their staked capital for additional activities likes swapping, or earning yield.
- **Flexibility:** Enhances user participation in DeFi while retaining the security benefits of staking.

Think of liquid restaking as depositing money into a bank account to earn interest, and liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) as the **debit card** that allows you to spend or use the money while it is still earning interest.

## GlowSOL

Liquid restaking provides the **framework** for unlocking staked assets, while liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) are the **tools** that enable users to access liquidity, earn rewards, and participate in DeFi without sacrificing the benefits of staking.

GlowSOL is Glow Protocol’s native liquid restaking token, designed specifically for the Solana blockchain. By leveraging Solayer’s restaking infrastructure, GlowSOL provides a seamless and efficient way for users to restake their SOL while maintaining access to liquidity.

GlowSOL is designed to revolutionize the way users interact with staked assets in decentralized finance (DeFi). By combining liquidity, tradability, and yield generation, GlowSOL empowers users to maximize the utility of their staked SOL holdings without compromising on rewards.

## Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs)

Liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) are the **financial instruments** that enable liquid restaking. When users stake their assets, they receive a tokenized representation of the staked asset in return. These LRTs act as **receipts** that represent the value of the underlying staked assets while also making them **tradable** or **usable** within DeFi ecosystems.

For example:
- If you stake **SOL** through a liquid restaking protocol (e.g., Solayer via Glow Protocol), you receive an LRT such as **glowSOL** in return.
- glowSOL can then be used for swaps, as collateral for loans, or for yield farming, all while continuing to earn staking rewards.

**Core Functions of LRTs:**
- **Representation of Staked Assets:** LRTs are pegged to the value of the staked assets (e.g., 1 glowSOL = value of 1 staked SOL plus rewards).
- **Tradability:** LRTs can be traded on decentralized exchanges or used in DeFi applications.
- **Rewards Accumulation:** The underlying staked assets continue to accrue staking rewards, and these rewards are reflected in the LRT's value.

## The Relationship

Liquid restaking is the **concept**, while liquid restaking tokens are the **implementation mechanism** that makes liquid restaking possible. Without LRTs, liquid restaking could not function effectively because:

1. **LRTs Provide Liquidity:** By issuing tokens like glowSOL, the protocol allows users to trade or utilize their staked assets without waiting for unstaking periods.
2. **LRTs Enable DeFi Integration:** The tokenized representation of staked assets allows them to be integrated into DeFi strategies, expanding their utility beyond staking.
3. **LRTs Reflect Staking Rewards:** They dynamically represent the value of the staked asset, including accumulated rewards, ensuring users retain full value even while accessing liquidity.
