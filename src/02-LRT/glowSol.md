glowSOL is a **liquid restaking token (LRT)** that represents staked SOL assets via [Solayer](https://docs.solayer.org/getting-started/introduction), combining liquidity and tradability with the ability to earn staking rewards. Designed as part of the Glow Finance ecosystem, glowSOL provides users with an innovative way to access their staked assets without forfeiting rewards, unlocking additional use cases within decentralized finance (DeFi).

glowSOL offers enhanced utility through its integration with the Glow Money Market, powering advanced DeFi strategies and making it a key component of Glowâ€™s liquid restaking ecosystem.

glowSOL stands out due to its automated processes:

- The **Restaking Process** automatically converts SOL to glowSOL while securely managing sSOL.
- The **Redeem Process** ensures a transparent withdrawal system, with alerts for admins to manage liquidity.

## Unlock Liquidity for Restaked Assets

glowSOL allows users to access liquidity without waiting for the traditional staking lock-up period, enabling immediate use of their staked assets. Users can use their glowSOL in various DeFi activities, lending, or collateralizing other positions within Glow Finance.

## Earn Rewards While Maintaining Liquidity

Users earn staking yield, Glow Points, Solayer Points, and AVS rewards while retaining the flexibility to trade or leverage their glowSOL holdings.
