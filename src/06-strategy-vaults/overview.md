## What Is a Strategy Vault?

A **Strategy Vault** is a vault that runs a pre-built, automated DeFi strategy composed of a coordinated sequence of actions — such as depositing collateral, borrowing, restaking, swapping, or creating long/short positions — executed through a single guided flow.

Users choose a few settings, such as how much they want to deposit and their preferred risk level, then confirm the transaction to create the Strategy Vault position. From there, Glow handles execution automatically. Once the Strategy Vault is live, users can easily manage their position and track performance in real time through a simple, user-friendly dashboard.

Strategy Vaults are designed to make advanced on-chain actions more accessible by wrapping complex workflows in a simplified, guided experience.

Each Strategy Vault can have:

- Its own strategy logic (e.g. leveraged staking, stablecoin farming, delta-neutral positions)
- An isolated margin account used to execute the strategy
- Custom parameters and risk settings
- Unique yield opportunities, rewards, and fee structures

### Built for Modularity

Glow Strategy Vaults are modular and designed to evolve. New strategies — and new assets — can be added over time. Each Strategy Vault has its own page with specific instructions, risks, and FAQs.
